## About

The Coriolis project was inspired by [E:D Shipyard](http://www.edshipyard.com/) and, of course, [Elite Dangerous](http://www.elitedangerous.com). The ultimate goal of Coriolis is to provide rich features to support in-game play and planning while engaging the E:D community to support its development.

Coriolis was created using assets and imagery from Elite: Dangerous, with the permission of Frontier Developments plc, for non-commercial purposes. It is not endorsed by nor reflects the views or opinions of Frontier Developments and no employee of Frontier Developments was involved in the making of it.
